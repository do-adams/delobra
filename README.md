Delobra [**de**lete **lo**cal **bra**nches] is a simple shell script for the opinionated Git user that takes care of doing some seasonal branch removal in your repository.

Delobra's job is to compile a list of branches to queue for deletion, check in with you, and (with your approval) delete the branches from your repository.
